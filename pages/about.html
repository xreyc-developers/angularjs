    <b>About Me</b>
    <p>
      I am a self-taught developer. I started learning to programing when I was in my 4th year of high school 
      because I am fascinated by how the technology works. That led me to take an engineering course where I 
      learned a lot of concepts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than playing video games, I pursued learning to programing because this is one of my interests. 
      I actually want to become really good in all of my interests, that’s why I never stopped learning them 
      until I get what I want.
    </p>
    <div id="about_experience"></div>
    <p>
      I am trying to learn advanced topics in programming because I want to single-handedly build my own website 
      someday - one that will help people learn, socialize, and communicate.

    <b>Experience</b>
    <p>
      I don’t have actual experience working in a company yet since I was still studying, so most of my experience 
      are through freelance work. The first projects I built as a programmer includes an employee record system, 
      Simple USB Antivirus, and some other stuff using Visual basic 2010. Those are during my high school days, where 
      everything was difficult at first for I was learning everything on my own. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went to college, I started learning web development. Based on my research, it was the trend that time, 
      so I decided to learn some basics like HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had many IT friends who were struggling on building their projects which are based on web development 
      because most of the subjects they were taught were based on java. So I made a deal with them about me taking 
      the work for them since I already have experience PHP basics. Thus, this is where I get my first freelance job. 
      I built a lot of websites where students are my main clients, here are some project I built:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. MVC Online Job Employment</b><br>
      <b>2. Maternity Record System</b><br>
      <b>3. Villahermosa Dental Clinic Record System</b><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id="about_website"></div>
      After several years, I tried to get some online freelance jobs as a web developer through Upwork, where 
      everything was completely different because I was handling actual business websites. Some of the website I 
      done are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. IGL Laboratories</b><br>
      <b>2. Sarasota</b>
    </p>

    <b>About this website</b>
    <p>
      This website is built with AngularJS, bootstrap styling only, I didn't put any database on it
      because I am planning to transform this into a blog. I made some solution for me to run this 
      website in a cheapest way, I registered on 000webhost as a free hosting and buy 
      a domain name in external site which cost me around 100 peso then link them together.       
      My paypal only have 400 peso left from my last freelance job I done, so I make a way to use less 
      money as posible because I want to use an actual domain for the website. I am planning to  rebuilt 
      it with VueJS, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails or Django and PostgreSQL.
