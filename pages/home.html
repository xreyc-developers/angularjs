      I have used many implementations on the frontend and backend technologies 
      like Object Oriented Programming(OOP) and MVC architecture introduced by big 
      giants in the industry. In this section, I am going to show you what I actually 
      do when implementing web architecture in both frontend and backend development.

            This is my favorite among the three frameworks/library for building SPA not just 
            because of its simplicity but also because it is progressive and easy to maintain. 
            Its syntax looks like AngularJS and ReactJS mixed which makes me love this framework.

          I use <b>Vuex</b> for state management because it blends well with VueJS than Redux, maybe 
          because it takes advantage by building it based on VueJS core.

            Based on my understanding and experience with Vue + Vuex, this is how the data 
            flows inside of vuex library, where components only trigger an action and get 
            data via getters. Actions don't care about the state, it only deals with the 
            business logic where calculations, API and other operations are involved.

        <p>
          ReactJS basically is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user 
          interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling view layer 
          for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

        <p>
          <div id="home_angular"></div>
          Redux works just like Vuex, however, they have a different process of handling the state. 
          State and actions are handled by the reducer, it takes a new set of data from the action 
          and using state data as the initial data and finally updates the state that can be accessed 
          everywhere in the application.

        <p>
            I have less experience on this amongst the three frameworks here, I actually did some 
            projects using it but not the version 2. I created an online quiz website using angularJS 
            (Angular 1) which I blend it with vanilla PHP as the back end. Some people say it is 
            easier to learn than ReactJS, so using this on a future project wouldn't be a problem. 
            I've done some practice using Angular 7 where the terminal is always used in creating 
            components, service, and some other stuff. The photo shows my current knowledge of 
            implementing it, but I think I can perform better than what I’ve done on the sample.

        <p>
          <div id="home_nodejs"></div>
          I always use this library because it is easy to blend with the backend and easy to 
          deploy on the web. I normally use this library when I am using a shared hosting where 
          you have no root access to install some application.

        <div class="article-head">NodeJS</div>
        <p>
          Based on my understanding, NodeJS is a <b>runtime environment</b> for running JavaScript. 
          It enables running JavaScript code outside a browser by using the Google Chrome's V8 engine. 
          Since it runs JavaScript as a backend application, it enables running queries in an 
          asynchronous fashion means non-blocking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is my favorite among the three backend services here because you can implement codes 
          in a less opinionated way. Based on the implementation I’ve shown in the picture, 
          I refactor the files to make the application more maintainable.

                <div id="home_laravel"></div>
      <div id="home_django"></div>
          I distributed the index.js code to the startup folder in order to beautify the structure of 
          the application. Separating the models, routes and middleware is a good practice since model 
          and middleware is reusable in every route by injecting it on a particular route. I use packages 
          that are mainly used to standardized my application such as <b>Express, Mongoose, Json web token,
          Config, Lodash, Fawn, Joi, Winston, Bcrypt, and many other packages.</b>

        <p>
          I am more comfortable on this framework than Django since I used PHP on most of my
          project for the past 4 years. What I like with this framework is that everything is
          already handled like error handling and other stuff. I used this framework on the 
          backend application only by passing some JSON data dependent on the URL endpoint I set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I learned this framework I spent a lot of time building my backend application 
          using PHP(OOP) which uses classes in order to build a secure website. I am using 
          JWT(Json Web Token) package for user authentication because I want to blend it with 
          other application and designate my work front the frontend side of the application.

        <div class="article-head">Python Django</div>
        <p>
          Django is my newly learned framework and my ideal framework for the backend application 
          (other than rails) because it is based on Python which has many capabilities like machine learning, 
          data science, and many other applications. When I planned to learn Django Framework, I started to 
          learn python, which confused me at first because to of its naming convention, like dictionaries 
          which are called array in many languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          When started learning in Django, my main objective was to learn how to create REST API using this 
          framework because I'll be using VueJS on my frontend application. I learned many things about this 
          framework like serializer, generic API view and other things that are new to my experience.

      Rather than playing games and any other stuff, programming is actually my hobby. I am flexible on 
      creating web-based applications based on my current knowledge and is still learning other applications 
      that are trendy this year. I am soon planning to learn other languages like Ruby on Rails, which is used 
      by big companies that are successful today.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I am going to learn next is Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET since these frameworks are good in terms of 
      startup project based on my research. I normally can learn a framework just within two weeks or less 
      since all I just have to learn is how to implement building a rocket on the other side of the land. 
      After this, will be Android and IOS development, since it is a requirement for complete startup projects.
